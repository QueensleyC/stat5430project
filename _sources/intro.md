# Welcome to SeeingStats

Welcome! SeeingStats is your space to explore statistics in a clear, visual, and hands-on way.
This book was created to help you understand statistics by seeing it, not just memorizing formulas.

Here, you’ll find:

- simple explanations

- visual workflows

- diagrams that break down big ideas

- examples you can run and play with

- short notes that connect concepts together

Whether you’re learning these ideas for the first time or revisiting them with fresh eyes, the goal is to make statistics feel intuitive and approachable.

Take your time, click around, and explore the chapters in the sidebar.
More content will be added as the book grows — so feel free to come back anytime.
